<h1>Deploying Active Directory in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This is a project that I did outlining the implementation of Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Set up Resources in Azure.
- Ensure Connectivity between client and Domain Controller.
- Install Active Directory.
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in Active Directory.
- Add Client-1 to the created Domain
- Set up remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Create additional users

<h2>Setting Up Resources in Azure</h2>

![Creating VM for Domain Controller ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef876fa8-202a-40ea-86f2-d00ae63faf2e)
- Created Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022). Took note of virtual network and resource group. This is so I could put the the Client in the same resource group and virtual network.

![Making DC-1 private IP static](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ddd5e2-7b6c-414a-9e61-820ce2883f7f)

- Changed Domain Controller's private Ip to static because it will act as a DNS server. This will be make it easier to find for clients. Also security. Network firewalls often have rules based on IP addresses.A static IP for a domain controller allows for more precise and secure firewall configurations. Â

- Created the Client VM and used the same Virtual Network and Resource Group used for the Domain Controller.

<h2>Ensuring Connectivity Between the client and Domain Controller</h2>

![RDP Client 1 from my computer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2079f459-fbde-4bdd-97eb-88aae5303530)

![After Enabling ICMPv4 Traffic replies](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c33c7ed-03de-4b1e-b227-c60e02b0ca24)




- Logged into client 1 with the credentials I created earlier in Azure.

- Logged into Domain Controller with the credentials I created earlier in Azure.

- I navigated to Windows Defender Firewall in the Domain Controller. Windows Defender -> Advanced Settings -> Inbound rules -> Enable ICMP4

- Used ping command to check for connectivity in Domain Controller 1.

- Connectivity Confirmed.


<h2>Installation of Active Directory Steps</h2>

![promote DC-1 to domAin controller](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da56f563-0b8d-49f1-94e7-3248fb5fe738)

- Installed Active Directory on Windows server.  Add Roles and Features -> Select Active Directory Domain Services.

- Select Server Roles -> Check Active Directory Domain Services.

- Added new forest (domain) jonathanwcislo.com

- Clicked little yellow triangle to promote server to Domain Controller.


<h2>Creating Admin and Normal User</h2>

- Created Admins and Employee Organizational Units.
- Created Jonny_admin account.
- Create Jane Doe user account.
- Logging back in after making server a Domain Controller.

![Successfully joined client 1 to domain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a609d1f-f0e1-44eb-9053-ec7ebd25d481)



-From the Azure Portal I set Client 1's DNS settings to the Domain Controller's Private IP and restarted the Client 1 form Azure.

-Logged into Client 1 to check if DNS server had changed to Domain Controller IP using Ipconfig.

- Added Client 1 to Domain jonathanwcislo.com  Start -> System -> Rename this PC

- Successfully added Client-1 to the Domain.


  


<h2>Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client 1</h2>

- Logged into Client 1 as jonathnwcislo.com\jonny_admin
- Clicked on Remote Desktop System Properties -> Allow Domain Users access to remote desktop.
- This would normally been done with Group Policy to configure many machines
