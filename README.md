<h1>Deploying Active Directory in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This is a project that I did outlining the implementation of Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Set up Resources in Azure.
- Ensure Connectivity between client and Domain Controller.
- Install Active Directory.
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in Active Directory.
- Add Client-1 to the created Domain
- Set up remote Desktop for non-adminstrative users on Client-1
- Create additional users

<h2>Setting Up Resources in Azure</h2>

![Creating VM for Domain Controller ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef876fa8-202a-40ea-86f2-d00ae63faf2e)
Created Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022). Took note of virtual network and resource group. This is so I could put the the Client in the same reosurce group and virtual network.

![Making DC-1 private IP static](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ddd5e2-7b6c-414a-9e61-820ce2883f7f)

Changed Domain Controller's private Ip to static because it will act as a DNS server. This will be make it easire to find for clients. Also security. Network firewalls often have rules based on IP addresses.A static IP for a domain controller allows for more precise and secure firewall configurations. Â

![Correct VN for Client-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e90f803-968c-4b83-af03-b512681f57e8)


Created the Client VM and used the same Virtual Network and Resource Group used for the Domain Controller.

<h2>Ensuring Connectivity Betwen the client and Domain Controller</h2>

![enabling ICMPv4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d7c67eb-2bfb-4169-856c-d8ce8123c431)


Logged into client 1 with the credentials I created earlier in Azure.
Logged into Domain Controller with the credentials I created earlier in Azure.
I navigated to Windows Defender Firewall in the Domain Controller. Windows Defender -> Advanced Settings -> Inbound rules -> Enable ICMP4
